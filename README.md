## Motivation
Bluetility is inspired by [LightBlue](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lightblue/id639944780?mt=12), a free bluetooth utility published by [Punch Through Design](https://punchthrough.com/).  Bluetility was created to resolve issues in this tool, and add missing features:

* Support copy/paste via Cmd+C and Cmd+V
* Sort peripherals by received signal strength
* View advertising data
* Automatically reconnect to disconnect peripherals when needed

Bluetility is published as open-source so that anyone can tweak or improve its functionality to meet their own needs.
